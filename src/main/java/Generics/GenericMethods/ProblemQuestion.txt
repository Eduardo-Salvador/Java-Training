Generic Printing:
Create a generic method called printArray that receives an array of any type and prints all its elements. Test with Integer, String, and Double arrays.

Generic Maximum:
Create a generic method called maxValue that receives three elements and returns the largest one. Use type restriction (extends Comparable)
to ensure that the elements can be compared. Test with numbers (Integer, Double) and with String.

Generic Swap:
Create a generic method called swap that swaps two elements of an array in different positions. Test with String and Integer arrays.

Generic Search:
Create a generic method called containsElement that checks if an element is present in a list. Test with String and Integer lists.

Extra Challenge:
Create a generic method called copyList that copies the elements of one list to another, using wildcards (? extends T and ? super T).
Test it by copying a list of integers to a list of numbers.
