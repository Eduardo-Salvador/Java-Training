EN-US:
Create a simple log system:

Check if file logs/app.log exists using File.exists()
If it doesn't exist, create the logs/ directory with mkdir() and the file
Use BufferedWriter to add 3 log lines (append mode)
Use BufferedReader to read and show all content
Show the file size in bytes using File.length()

Comment: Always use BufferedReader/Writer in production! Reading/writing character by character with FileReader/Writer is very slow. The buffer accumulates data in memory before writing to disk.
