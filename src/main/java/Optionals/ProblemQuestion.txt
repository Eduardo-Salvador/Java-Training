Exercise 1 — User Profile Search with Optional:
Create a User class with the following attributes:
id (integer)
name (String)
email (String)

Requirements:
Create a UserRepository class containing a method `Optional<User> findByEmail(String email)` that returns:
`Optional.of(user) was found`
`Optional.empty() was not found`
In the main method, create a list with some registered users.

Perform searches using `findByEmail` and use:
`ifPresent()` to display the name of the found user.
`ifPresentOrElse()` to display: "User not found" when the Optional is empty.
`orElse()` to return a default user.
`orElseGet()` to generate an alternate user only when necessary.
`orElseThrow()` to throw a custom exception when the user does not exist.
Apply a `map()` to the returned Optional to extract only the username.
Use `filter()` to return an Optional only if the email contains "@gmail.com".
