PriorityQueue
Now imagine an emergency queue in a hospital.
Each patient has a name and a priority level (the lower the number, the greater the urgency).
Patients are seen not in order of arrival, but according to medical priority.
Your task is to create a patient queue using PriorityQueue, insert some patients with different priority levels, and simulate the process until everyone is seen.
In the end, show the order in which the patients were seen.
