Exercise – City Management:
You must create a small system that manages cities in a country.
The goal is to practice using Iterators and converting between Lists and Arrays.

Requirements:
Create a City class with the following attributes:
Sequence name
Integer population
Create a CityManager class with the following methods:
addCity(List<City> cities, City city)
Adds a new city to the list.
Displays a message confirming the addition.
removeSmallCities(List<City> cities, int minPopulation)
Use an Iterator to remove all cities with a population less than minPopulation.
Displays the removed cities.
convertListToArray(List<City> cities)
Converts a list into an array (City[]).
Displays the contents of the array.
convertArrayToList(City[] cityArray)
Convert the array back into a list.
Display the contents of the new list.

Tips:
Use `Iterator<City> iterator = cities.iterator();` to iterate and remove.
Remember to use `iterator.remove()` inside the loop, never `cities.remove()` directly.

To convert:
`List → Array:` `City[] array = cities.toArray(new City[0]);`
`Array → List:` `List<City> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));`
