Exercise: Phone Book with TreeMap (NavigableMap)
Create a program that manages a phone book using TreeMap or NavigableMap.

Requirements:
Create a Contact class with:
String name
String phoneNumber
String email

In the main program:
Create a NavigableMap<String, Contact>, where the key will be the contact's name and the value will be the Contact object itself.
Add at least 5 contacts.
Display all contacts in alphabetical order by name.
Show the first and last contact in the phone book.
Given a name, show:
the immediately preceding contact (lowerEntry)
the immediately following contact (higherEntry)
Display the phone book in reverse order (use descendingMap()).

Extra Challenges:
Allow removing a contact by name.
Allow updating the phone number or email of an existing contact.
Use methods like:
firstEntry(), lastEntry()
lowerEntry(), higherEntry()
descendingMap()
