Mixed Hospital Queue System:
Imagine you are developing a patient care system for an emergency room.
Patients arrive and are registered in a regular queue, in order of arrival.
However, some patients have urgent cases and need to be seen before others. These patients are placed in a PriorityQueue,
where priority is defined by a number (the lower the number, the greater the urgency).

he system should work like this:
Whenever there are patients in the PriorityQueue, they are seen first (in order of priority).
If there are no urgent patients, the care follows the order of the regular queue.
After each patient visit, the system shows who was seen and which queue was used.
Continue until all queues are empty.

Objective:
Create two structures: a queue for regular patients and a PriorityQueue for urgent patients.
Simulate the arrival of patients in both queues.
Implement a service logic that always prioritizes the urgent queue.
Show the final service order.
