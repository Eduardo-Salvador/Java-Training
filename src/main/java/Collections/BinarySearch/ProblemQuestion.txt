Exercise – Binary Book Search:
You have been hired to develop a small book search system for a digital library.
The goal is to allow users to quickly locate a book by title using binary search (Collections.binarySearch).

Requirements:
Create the Book class with the following attributes:
String title
String author
Integer year
Have the Book class implement Comparable<Book>, where the natural order will be by title in alphabetical order.

Create a LibrarySearch class with:
A searchBook(List<Book> books, String title) method that:
Sorts the list of books by title.
Uses Collections.binarySearch() to search for the book.
Returns the found book, or displays a message if it does not exist.

Create the main class Main to:
Create a list of 5 books.
Display the sorted list.
Perform a binary search for an existing book and a non-existent book.

Tips:
The binarySearch() method requires the list to already be sorted according to the same criteria as compareTo.
If the book is not found, binarySearch() returns a negative value.
Remember to override toString() to display the book information.
