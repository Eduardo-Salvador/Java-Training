Order Processing System with Streams, flatMap, and Reduce:
Create the following classes:
Product
name (String)
price (Double)

Item
product (Product)
quantity (Integer)

Order
id (Integer)
items (List<Item>)

Requirements:
In the main method, do the following:
Create a list of Orders, each containing several Items, and each Item containing a Product with a price.

Using Streams + flatMap:
Convert the list of orders into a single stream of all items from all orders.
(Use orders.stream().flatMap(order -> order.getItems().stream()))

From this item stream:
Transform each item into its total value (price * quantity).
(Use map(...))

Using reduce, calculate:
The total value of all orders summed.
(Ex.: reduce(0.0, (a, b) -> a + b) or via Double::sum)

Display in the console:
The consolidated total value of all orders.

Extra (optional, still using Stream + flatMap + reduce):
Find the most expensive order by summing its items individually (each order → stream → reduce → compare via max).
Find the best-selling product by total quantity (sum quantities by name using reduce or groupingBy + manual reduce).
