Generating Streams and Using Summarizing:
Create a Transaction class with the following attributes:
id (Integer)
value (Double)
type (String) // e.g., "DEPOSIT", "WITHDRAW"

Requirements:
In the main method, generate different types of Streams:
A Stream from a List<Transaction>.
A Stream created with Stream.of(...).
A numeric Stream with IntStream.range(...).
An infinite Stream using Stream.generate(...) limited with limit().

From the list of transactions:
Filter only the transactions of type "DEPOSIT".
Transform the values into a DoubleStream using mapToDouble().

Use the summary statistics methods:
DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = stream.summaryStatistics();

Extract from stats:
total sum (getSum())
average (getAverage())
highest value (getMax())
lowest value (getMin())
quantity (getCount())
Display all statistics in the console.

Extra challenge:
Generate an infinite stream of random numbers between 1 and 100, limit it to 20 values, and present a statistical summary using summaryStatistics().
