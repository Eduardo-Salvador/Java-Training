Exercise: LinkedList (Service Queue)
Create a program that simulates a technical support service queue using LinkedList.

Requirements:
Create a Client class with:
client name;
problem description;
toString() method returning name and problem.

Without main program:
Create a LinkedList<Customer> representing the queue.
Add 5 clients to the queue (in order of arrival).

Show:
the first in the queue;
the service of a client (removing the first);
the current size of the queue;
the complete queue after each service.

Use LinkedList methods such as:
addLast(), removeFirst(), peekFirst(), isEmpty(), size().

Extra challenge (optional):
Make the queue not accept duplicate customers (same name).
Add an option to serve all customers until the queue is empty.
Replace LinkedList with Queue<Customer> and see what changes.
