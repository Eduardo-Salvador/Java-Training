Exercise: Book Catalog with TreeSet (NavigableSet)
Create a program that manages a book catalog using TreeSet.

Requirements:
Create a Book class with:
title (String)
author (String)
number of pages (Integer)
The class must implement Comparable<Book> so that the default sorting is alphabetical by title.

In the main program:
Create a TreeSet<Book> (or NavigableSet<Book>).
Add 5 different books to the set.
Display the books in alphabetical order.

Show:
the first and last book in the order;
the book immediately before and after a specific book (use lower() and higher());
the catalog in reverse order (use descendingSet()).
