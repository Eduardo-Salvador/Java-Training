Exercise: Product Inventory Control
Create a program that manages a product inventory using Map.

Requirements:
Create a Product class with:
name (String)
code (String)
price (Double)

In the main program:
Create a HashMap<String, Product> where the key will be the product code and the value will be the Product object itself.
Add 5 products to the map.
Display all registered products (showing the code as the key).
Check if a code already exists before adding it.
Update the price of a specific product.
Remove a product by code.
Show the total number of registered products.
Show the products in order of insertion (use LinkedHashMap for this).
