Exercise: Registering Unique Employees
Create a program that stores employees in a list (ArrayList).
Two employees should be considered equal if they have the same CPF (Brazilian tax identification number).

Requirements:
Create an Employee class with:
Private attributes: String name, String cpf, Double salary.
Constructor and getter/setter methods.
Override the equal method to consider two employees equal if their CPF is the same.
Also override hashCode (using cpf.hashCode()).

Lesson Director:
Create an `ArrayList<Funcional>`.
Add some employees (including a repeated CPF).
Before adding, check if the employee already exists in the list using the `contains()` method.

If it already exists, do not add it and display a message:
"Employee with CPF already registered: <cpf>".
Finally, display all registered employees.

Expected Example (simulated output)
Employee with already registered CPF: 123.456.789-00
Registered Employees:
Name: Ana, CPF: 123.456.789-00, Salary: 4500.00
Name: Bruno, CPF: 987.654.321-00, Salary: 5200.00
