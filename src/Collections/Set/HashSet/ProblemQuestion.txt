Exercise – Working with Set and HashSet:
Create a Java program that manages a set of emails registered in a system.

Requirements:
Create a User class with the following attributes:
String name
String email
Override the equals() and hashCode() methods so that two users are considered equal if they have the same email, regardless of their name.

In the main method, do the following:
Create a Set<User> (use HashSet).
Add at least 5 users, 2 of whom have the same email.
Try adding a duplicate user again (with an already existing email).
Display the size of the set (how many unique users there are).
List all users in the Set.

Extra challenges:
Ask the user to enter an email (via Scanner) and check if it is already registered.
Remove a user by email, if it exists.
Show the updated set again.
