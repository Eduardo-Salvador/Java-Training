Exercise – Student Sorting:
Create a program to manage a list of students (Student) in a school.
Implement the system so that it is possible to sort the students in different ways.

Requirements:
Create the Student class with the following attributes:
String name
Integer age
Double grade (final grade)
Make the Student class implement Comparable<Student>,
so that the natural order of the objects is by name in alphabetical order.
Create two comparators (Comparator<Student>) to sort:
By ascending age
By descending grade
Create a main class StudentManager that:
Creates a list (List<Student>)
Adds 5 different students

Shows:
The original list
The list sorted by name (Comparable)
The list sorted by age (Comparator)
The list sorted by descending grade (Comparator)

Rules and Tips:
Use Collections.sort() for sorting with Comparable.
Use list.sort() for sorting with Comparator.
Use the forEach(System.out::println) method to print the list.
Keep the code well organized and modularized.
