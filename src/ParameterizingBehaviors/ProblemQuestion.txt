Payment Processing System with Behavior Parameterization:
Create a class called PaymentProcessor that will be responsible for processing different payment methods.

Requirements:
Define a functional interface called PaymentStrategy with a single method:
void pay(double amount);
In the PaymentProcessor class, create a method called processPayment(double amount, PaymentStrategy strategy)
that delegates the payment behavior to the strategy received as a parameter.

In the main method, create different payment strategies using lambda expressions or anonymous classes, for example:
Credit Card Payment (prints: "Payment of <amount> with credit card").
Pix Payment (prints: "Payment of <amount> via Pix").
Bank Slip Payment (prints: "Payment of <amount> with bank slip").
Test the system by calling processPayment with different values and strategies.

Extra Challenge:
Create a list of different payment strategies and iterate over it, processing the same amount with each one.
Add a strategy that applies a discount before making the payment.
