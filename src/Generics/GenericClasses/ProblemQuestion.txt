Generic Box:
You need to implement a generic class called Box<T> that can store any type of object.

Objectives:
Create the Box<T> class with:
A private attribute called content of type T.
Methods setContent(T content) and getContent() to manipulate the content.
A toString() method that prints the box's content.

In the main method, create different instances of the Box:
A Box<String> to store a word.
A Box<Integer> to store a number.
A Box<Animal> to store an object of the Animal class.
Show that the same Box class works for different types without needing to duplicate code.

Extra Challenge:
Implement a generic class Pair<K, V> that stores a pair of values (as a key and a value).
Create instances like Pair<String, Integer> (e.g., "Age", 25) and Pair<String, String> (e.g., "Name", "John").
Print the pairs to see how it works.
