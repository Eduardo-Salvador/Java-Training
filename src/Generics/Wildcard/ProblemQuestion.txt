Animal Report with Wildcards
You are creating a system to manage different types of animals in a zoo.
There is a base class called Animal and subclasses such as Dog, Cat, and Lion.
You need to implement a method that receives a generic list of animals and prints information about them.
The detail is that the method must accept any type of list that contains objects that are subtypes of Animal.
To do this, you must use wildcards (? extends Animal).

Objectives:
Create the Animal class with a makeSound() method.
Create subclasses (Dog, Cat, Lion) that override makeSound().
Create a printAnimalSounds(List<? extends Animal> animals) method that iterates through the list and calls makeSound() for each animal.
Test the method by passing different lists (List<Dog>, List<Cat>, etc.).

Extra Challenge:
Also implement an addAnimal(List<? super Animal> animals, Animal a) method that adds an animal to a list that can accept Animal or supertypes.
This will show you the difference between `? extends` (reading) and `? super` (writing).
