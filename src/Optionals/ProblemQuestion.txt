Exercise 1 — User Profile Search with Optional:
Create a User class with the following attributes:
id (integer)
name (String)
email (String)

Requirements:
Create a UserRepository class containing a method `Optional<User> findByEmail(String email)` that returns:
`Optional.of(user) was found`
`Optional.empty() was not found`
In the main method, create a list with some registered users.

Perform searches using `findByEmail` and use:
`ifPresent()` to display the name of the found user.
`ifPresentOrElse()` to display: "User not found" when the Optional is empty.
`orElse()` to return a default user.
`orElseGet()` to generate an alternate user only when necessary.
`orElseThrow()` to throw a custom exception when the user does not exist.
Apply a `map()` to the returned Optional to extract only the username.
Use `filter()` to return an Optional only if the email contains "@gmail.com".

Exercise 2 — Product Price Analyzer with Optional and flatMap:
Create the following classes:
Product
name (String)
price (Double)
Order
id (Integer)
product (Optional<Product>)
An order can exist even without a product registered.

Requirements:
In the main method, create several Orders with products and some without products.
Create a method Optional<Double> getProductPrice(Order order) that:
Uses flatMap() to access the Product Optional.
Returns Optional.of(price) when there is a product.
Returns Optional.empty() when the order has no product.

In the main method, for each order:
Use orElse() to return 0.0 if the price does not exist.
Use map() to apply a 10% discount only when the price is present.
Use `filter()` to return an Optional only if the price is greater than 100.

Display:
the original price
the discounted price (if applicable)
“Product not available” using `orElseGet()`

Exercise 3 — Library Book Loan System using Optional Chains:

Create the classes:
Author
name (String)

Book
title (String)
author (Optional<Author>)

Loan
book (Optional<Book>)

Requirements:
In main, create several books:
some with a defined author
others without an author
And create several loans (some without an attached book).

Create a method:
Optional<String> getAuthorName(Loan loan)

that:
Uses a chain of flatMap() to navigate: Loan → Book → Author → Name
Returns Optional.of(name) if the author exists.
Returns Optional.empty() if any step is missing.

In main, show:
The author's name using orElse("Unknown author")
A call using orElseThrow() when the author does not exist. A transformation using `map()` to return the name in uppercase.
A `filter()` to return the author only if the name has more than 5 letters.
Use `ifPresent()` to display the authors found.

Example of expected chain:
`loan.getBook()`
`.flatMap(Book::getAuthor)`
`.map(Author::getName)`
