Employee Stream Processing:
Create a class called Employee with the following attributes:
name (String)
age (Integer)
salary (Double)

Requirements:
In the main method:
Create a list with several employees containing varying ages and salaries.
Using Stream, perform the following operations:
Filter: select only employees with salaries above 5000.
Map: transform each employee into a string containing only:
"NAME - SALARY"
Sorted: sort by name in alphabetical order.
Distinct: ensure there are no duplicate names.
Collect: transform the final result into a List<String>.

Using terminal operations:
`count()` → number of employees above 5000
`max(Comparator)` → employee with the highest salary
`min(Comparator)` → employee with the lowest salary
`anyMatch()` → is there anyone older than 60?
`allMatch()` → do all employees have a salary above 2000?
`noneMatch()` → are there no employees with empty names?

Display in the console:
The final formatted list
The count
The highest salary
The lowest salary
The results of `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`
