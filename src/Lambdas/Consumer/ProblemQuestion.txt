Product Processing System with Consumer:

Create a class called Product with the following attributes:
name (String)
price (Double)

Requirements:
In the main class, create a list of products with different names and prices.
Create a utility method called processProducts(List<Product> products, Consumer<Product> action) that receives:
The list of products.
A Consumer<Product> that defines the action to be applied to each product.
The method should iterate over the list and apply the Consumer to each item.

In the main class, use lambda expressions to create different Consumer<Product> and test the method:
One that prints the product name and price.
One that applies a 10% discount to the price and prints the new value.
One that prints only the names in uppercase letters.
Execute the processProducts method with each Consumer and observe the results.

Extra Challenge:
Create a list of Consumer<Product> and apply them all sequentially to each product (e.g., first print, then apply discount, then print in uppercase).
Combine Consumer using the andThen() method to chain actions into a single process.
