Employee Filtering System with Predicate:
Create a class called Employee with the following attributes:
name (String)
age (Integer)
salary (Double)

Requirements:
In the main class, create a list of employees with different age and salary values.
Create a utility method called filterEmployees(List<Employee> employees, Predicate<Employee> condition) that receives:
The list of employees.
A Predicate<Employee> that defines the filtering condition.
The method should return only the employees that satisfy the condition.
In the main method, use lambda expressions to create different Predicate<Employee> and test the method:
Filter employees older than 30.
Filter employees with a salary above 5000.
Filter employees whose name begins with the letter "A".
Display the results of each filtering in the console.

Extra Challenge:
Combine two Predicates using the `and()` and `or()` methods.
Example: age > 30 and salary > 5000.
Example: name starts with "A" or salary < 3000.
Create a negated Predicate (`negate()`) to show employees who do not meet a given condition.
