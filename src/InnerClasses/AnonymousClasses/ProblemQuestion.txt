Event Notification System:
Create a program that simulates a simple notification system for events, using anonymous classes.

Requirements:
Create an interface called Notifier with one method:
void notifyUser(String message);

In the main program:
Create a class called Event with attributes:
private String name;
private String date;
and a constructor to initialize them.

In the main method:
Create a list of 3 events.
For each event, create an anonymous class that implements the Notifier interface and prints a message like:

[Email] New event registered: Tech Conference - 25/11/2025 or [SMS] Event reminder: Hackathon - 30/11/2025

Simulate sending notifications using different types (e.g., Email, SMS, Push) — all using anonymous classes (no named subclasses).
Print all notifications sent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anonymous Class with Inheritance:
Create a simple internal notification management system for a company.
Create a class called Notification with the attributes:
message (String)
priority (Integer)

Add a send() method that simply prints:
Sending notification: <message> (Priority: <priority>)

In the main method, create two instances of anonymous classes based on Notification, overriding the send() method for different behaviors:
A critical system notification, which prints the entire text in uppercase.
A regular user notification, which adds the user's name to the end of the message.
Create a list of Notification classes and add both instances.
Iterate through the list and call the send() method for each notification.

Extra challenge (optional):
Create an abstract class Alert with an abstract method execute().
Create two different anonymous classes that inherit from Alert and print distinct messages. Run both without creating named subclasses.
