Library Management System with Static Inner Classes:
Create a main class called Library that represents a library.

Requirements:
Within the Library class, create a static inner class called Book with the attributes:
title (String)
author (String)
year (Integer)
The Book class should have a method that displays the book information in a readable format.
In the main class, create a list of Book objects and add at least three different books.
Iterate over the list and display the information for each book.

Extra Challenge:
Create another static inner class called Statistics inside Library.

This class should have methods to:
Count how many books are in the list.
Calculate the average number of years of publication of the books.
In the main method, use this class to display these statistics.
